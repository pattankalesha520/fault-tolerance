### Abstract
This paper addresses fault tolerance challenges in distributed systems arising from static replica management and reactive recovery mechanisms. It examines the limitations of traditional replication approaches, including fixed redundancy, slow adaptation to workload dynamics, and inefficient resource utilization. The proposed AI-augmented replica management framework leverages machine learning and predictive analytics to anticipate failures and performance degradation proactively. By dynamically adjusting replica placement, replication factors, and synchronization strategies, the approach enhances system reliability while minimizing overhead. The study highlights the role of intelligent, self-healing replication in improving scalability, throughput, and resilience across modern distributed infrastructures.

### Key Contributions
- **Adaptive Fault-Tolerance Framework:**
  Proposed an AI-augmented replica management architecture that overcomes the limitations of static replication and reactive recovery by introducing predictive, self-adaptive fault-tolerance mechanisms.

- **Predictive Failure Management:**
  Integrated machine learning–based prediction and anomaly detection to anticipate node failures, performance degradation, and network instability before faults occur.
  
- **Reinforcement Learning–Driven Replication:**
  Applied reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize replication factor, replica placement, and synchronization frequency, balancing fault coverage with resource efficiency in real time.
  
- **Research & Implementation Leadership:**
  Led the design, implementation, and validation of an intelligent, self-healing replication system combining monitoring, prediction, learning, and optimization in distributed environments.

### Relevance & Real-World Impact
- **Improved Storage Efficiency:**
  Reduced disk space usage in distributed database systems by minimizing versioning overhead without compromising transaction correctness.

- **Scalable Distributed Deployment:**
Enabled more storage-efficient scaling of database clusters by adopting OCC in low-contention scenarios while retaining MVCC where strong consistency is required.

- **System-Level Performance Benefits:**
    Lowered garbage collection pressure and metadata management costs, resulting in improved throughput and reduced resource utilization.
  
- **Academic and Educational Value:**
    Provides empirical insights and implementation references for research and teaching in concurrency control, distributed databases, and storage optimization.
